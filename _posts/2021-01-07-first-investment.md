When I started my first job in June 2020, I've been earning decently. After few months, I wanted to enter into investing my money. I just want to take baby steps but not invest heavily at beginning and learn on the journey.

So I did my first investment on 11th Sep 2019. It is a mutual fund and bought at it's minimum investment amount ₹500.

The details are as follows:

MF Name | [ITI Long Term Equity Fund Direct - Growth](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ITI_LONG_TERM_15Y5KE6:MUTF_IN)
Investment | ₹500
Platform | [Paytm Money](https://www.paytmmoney.com/)
